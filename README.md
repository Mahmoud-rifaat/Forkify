# Forkify

1) Fetching data from a third-party API using the Fetch API, handling Async operation using ES6 features (promises and Async Await).

2) Rendering content by directly inserting it into the DOM.

3) Importing static resources using "import" and using relative paths.

4) Adding Polyfills for ES6 features.

5) Listening for Load and hashchange events on the window object, and reading the recipe id from the hash.

6) Refactoring code by separating Model (for business logic and API usage), View (for generating markup and rendering), Controller (for Controlling data flow between the first two and handling events).

7) Adding configuration file and helpers module.
